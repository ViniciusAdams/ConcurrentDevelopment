In this worksheet you will get exposure to working with Gradient
Descent by hand and also get exposure to it running on a machine.
You will have two sample problems for which you will calculate the first
three iterations by hand. After this you will adapt the gradient descent
code to run these problems to both verify that your calculations are
correct and understand how the algorithm functions.
You will also do some experimentation with the algorithm to see
how it functions.
NOTE: make sure you have access to a non programmable
calculator for this.
1 Gradient Descent Problems: Calculation
by Hand
For each of the problems listed below you are required to do the following:
• Determine the first derivative of the function
• With the given starting point determine the result of the first three
iterations of the algorithm. Solve in the same way as the examples in
the lecture notes.
The problems:
1. f(x) = 2x
3 + 6x
2 − 20x + 6 with x1 = 5
2. f(x) = x
4 − 20x
2 + 6 with x1 = 2
You may assume that gamma has a value of 0.001. keep calculations
to four digits of precision maximum and use rounding where needed, again
following the examples in the lecture notes. testing
